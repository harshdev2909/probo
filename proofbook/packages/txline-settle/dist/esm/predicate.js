/**
 * The predicate builder — and the part that stops you shipping an unsettleable
 * market.
 *
 * TxLINE evaluates a proof against an `NDimensionalStrategy`: a set of predicates
 * over the proven stats, AND-combined. Two rules govern it, neither documented,
 * both confirmed against the live oracle:
 *
 *   DuplicateStatCoverage (6070)   a stat evaluated twice
 *   IncompleteStatCoverage (6071)  a stat left unevaluated
 *
 * Every proven stat must be referenced EXACTLY ONCE. The consequence is
 * counter-intuitive and it is the thing that will bite you:
 *
 *   "home win AND over 2.5 goals"     -> BOTH legs read goals P1/P2.
 *                                        Rejected. There is no encoding for it.
 *   "home win AND over 9.5 corners"   -> goals {1,2} + corners {7,8}. Fine.
 *
 * So a compound predicate's legs must read DISJOINT stat families. `parlay()`
 * below throws if they do not, at build time, in your editor — rather than as a
 * failed CPI in production.
